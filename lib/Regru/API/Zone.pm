=head1 DESCRIPTION

REG.API DNS management methods such as create/remove resource records, enable/disable parking and forwarding features.

=apimethod nop

For testing purposes to check the ability to manage DNS resource records. This feature is available for domain names
that hosted by REG.RU DNS servers only. Scope: B<clients>. Typical usage:

    $resp = $client->zone->nop(
        domains => [
            { dname => 'bluth-company.com' },
            { dname => 'sitwell-enterprises.com' },
        ],
    );

Answer will contains a field C<domains> with a list of domain names which allows to manage resource records
or error otherwise.

More info at L<DNS management: nop|https://www.reg.com/support/help/api2#zone_nop>.

=apimethod add_alias

Creates an A (IPv4 address) resource record for domain(s). Scope: B<clients>. Typical usage:

    $resp = $client->zone->add_alias(

        ipaddr      => '172.26.14.51',
        domains     => [
            { dname => 'bluth-company.com' },
        ],
    );

B<NOTE> Also allowed to pass subdomain as C<@> (at) - resource record will point to domain itself or
C<*> (asterisk) - catch-all resource record.

Answer will contains a field C<domains> with a list of results for each involved to this operation domain names or
error otherwise.
